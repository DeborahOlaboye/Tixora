# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.



npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/EventTicketing.ts --network lisk_sepolia --verify

```shell
